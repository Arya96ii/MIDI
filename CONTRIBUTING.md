# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

## Pull Requests and Forks

We're excited to have others contribute to the APIs, tools, plug-ins, drivers and more! We generally recommend that contributors fork the project they are interested in, and then submit pull requests from their own forks. We'll review the PRs on a regular basis, and accept/decline or request additional information.

## Forks for other platforms

You may fork these projects as per the license. However, we highly recommend you consider contributing to the main project rather than spin off a separate and incompatible or competing project targeting Windows. In the end, we want to do what's right for musicians, music creation app / plug-in developers, and music hardware developers.

Forking to support other operating systems (including direct hardware devices) is also allowed and encouraged.
However, in that case, we again encourage you to consider what we can do together in the primary repo to support the requirements for these other platforms so that we can keep feature level, tool, and API parity, especially as the specifications evolve, or we fix bugs.

## Contributing image assets

Any images submitted must have clear license for use that is compatible with the Windows MIDI Services project. We cannot accept icons generated from other work without clear license, including images and fonts. Preference is given to icons/images created specifically for use in this project. Please adhere to the Contributor License Agreement when contributing. If there's any ambiguity, we will not be able to accept the contribution.

# What do I need to get started?

Projects generally use the most recent recent versions of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/), Windows 10/11 SDKs, [Windows App SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK), [Windows Community Toolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit) and [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) available at the time of authoring. Specific build requirements will be available in the readme for each sub project.

Projects are intended to be compiled on Windows, typically the latest release of Windows 11. Cross-compiling from another platform may be appropriate for some forks, but not necessaily for the main API, driver, and other components. Additionally, using toolchains other than Visual Studio are currently not supported for targeting Windows. When in doubt, ask.

# What should I contribute?

We'd love to have your help on this project, no matter what kind it is.

* Bug fixes
* Features
* Transport plug-ins
* Processing plug-ins
* Testing and bug reports (especially with different MIDI 1.0 and MIDI 2.0 hardware and software)
* Documentation
* Localization to a language you are fluent in

Testing and bug reports are the most critical, as everyone's setup is different. We want to ensure the project is as bug free and as performant as possible, with a large variety of PCs and peripherals.

For code, one place to start is by looking at the open issues here in Github, or discussions in the dedicated Discord server. When in doubt, ask the core team.
