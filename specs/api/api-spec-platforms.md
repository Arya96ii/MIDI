Supported developer platforms

# C++ and other similar languages

Standard C++ using the C++/WinRT library

# UWP / WinRT

Directly consume the WinRT projections

# .NET

Support .NET 7 at a minimum. Eventually move to and stabilize on .NET 8 in a future revision, assuming it's the long-term servicing version.

No planned support for .NET Framework. It may work, but will not be supported.

# .NET MAUI

Investigate. Should be available through WinRT support, if not native .NET
