# Client SDK

Rev 1 of this client-side SDK is written in C#/WinRT. It's possible we may change to C++/WinRT or C++/COM as we look at specific implementation use-cases.

Note that because it is in C#/.NET, any .NET app using this SDK must use the same CLR version that we are using. You cannot have multiple CLR versions loaded into the same process.
