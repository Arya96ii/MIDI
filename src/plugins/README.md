# Plug-ins

Why the plug-in approach?

We want to make it as easy as possible to add features to the API, without incurring any performance penalty when those features are not used. For that reason, a plug-in approach is the most flexible and performant option available.

When it comes to devices / transports, plug-ins also allow easy prototyping of new transports in a playground-type scenario, as well as easily adding new transports without authoring drivers in most cases.
