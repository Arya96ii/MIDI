# API

After reviewing the SDK with developers, we've factored out a minimal API Windows.Devices.Midi2. The SDK is the recommended way to use the API.

| Project | Description |
| -------- | --------------- |
| api-core | Main API for speaking to Windows MIDI Services |
| api-config | Runtime configuration. Most apps will not need to use most of this |
